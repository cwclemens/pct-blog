Hi! I'm Curt and I'm currently hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada -- 2650 miles! -- and I plan to finish sometime around early October. This blog is for any folks back home who want to follow my progress.

In addition to this blog, check out

- [Google Photos album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mPpHtjxDrNXhtJJd6) for more photos and a place to leave comments
- [Garmin tracking page](https://share.garmin.com/UJ32N) to see my progress in real time and send me messages directly

(I'm hoping to be able to leave these links up, but if they get abused, I'll take them down)
