## Day 35, 6/20

- 25 miles to Chimney Creek Campground.
- 1/4 of the trail done! (2650/4 = 662.5)
- Ran into Quarter Tank, Jinx, Jedi, Speedgoat, and Riveter. Jinx was meeting her husband Donnie at Chimney Creek campground. They invited me along to grab a beer and a burger.

- Got a cream soda and burger at the General Store
- Sooo many new hikers I haven't met before. This place is a vortex.
- Donnie gave us a ride down the road to Grumpy's.
- Got my packages. Finally replaced my shoes. 
- Got a shower and camped behind Grumpy's. Largest tent city I've seen since I was at Trail Days on the AT.

## About the Sierra

After Kennedy Meadows, I'll be hiking in the Sierra. The Sierra is often considered the most spectacular part of the PCT, but it's also the most difficult in a lot of ways.

Towns are very far off the trail in the Sierra. 
It usually takes the better part of a day of hiking on a side trail to get from the PCT to a trailhead where it's possible to hitch into town. Unlike the desert where I could get into and out of town in a single evening, in the Sierra, a town visit usually takes as much as three days.

The Sierra also has the highest peaks on the PCT. Forester Pass is the highest point on the PCT at over 14,000 ft. Mt Whitney is the tallest mountain in the continental US and is an 8-mile hike off the PCT on a side trail in the Sierra. I expect to be doing a lot of difficult climbing in the Sierra.

## Stats for nerds

| Stat | Value |
|:-----|------:|
| Miles hiked | 703.4 |
| Days hiked | 36 |
| Fraction of trail completed | 703.4 / 2650 = 26.5% |
| Ave. miles / day | 703.4 / 36 = 19.5 |
| Planned finish | 137 days |
| Pace needed to finish | (2650 - 703.4)/(137 - 36) = 19.27 mi/day |
